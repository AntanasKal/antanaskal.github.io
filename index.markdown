I am a PhD student at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) in Singapore supervised by [Dr Conrad Watt](https://conrad-watt.github.io/). My research interests are formal verification, mechanisation of programming language semantics, and WebAssembly language.

Prior to starting my PhD I worked at [Sensmetry](https://sensmetry.com/) back home in Lithuania. And before that I completed BA and MMath degrees in mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
